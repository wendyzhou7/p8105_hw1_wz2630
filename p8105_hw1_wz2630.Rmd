Problem 1
```{r}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)

data("early_january_weather")

# the variables in this dataset, including names / values of important variables
skimr::skim(early_january_weather)

# the size of the dataset
nrow(early_january_weather)

ncol(early_january_weather)

#the mean temperature
temp <- pull(early_january_weather, temp)
mean(temp)

#scatterplot

ggplot(early_january_weather, 
       aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + 
geom_point(aes(col = humid)) + 
labs(y = "Temperature", 
     x = "Time", 
     title = "Temperature at Different Times in Early January")

# In the early_january_weather, there are 358 observations and 15 variables. 

# There are many missing data in variables wind_gust and pressure. Based on the scatterplot, there are outliers of temperatures greater than 50 degrees and below 30 degrees. The variable time_hour observations are in year, month, day, and hour; temp and humid variables are in continuous numbers.

# The mean temperature is 39.58.

Problem 2
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = random_sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "medium", "medium", "medium", 
                        "high", "high", "high","high"))
            )

random_sample <- pull(df, random_sample)
mean(random_sample)

vec_logical <- pull(df, vec_logical)
mean(vec_logical)

# We cannot take the mean of 'vec_char' and 'vec_factor' because these variables are character values
# We can only take the mean of numerical variables

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
as.numeric(vec_logical)
as.numeric(vec_char)
as.numeric(vec_factor)
#The as.numeric function converts a character vector into a numeric vector.
```
