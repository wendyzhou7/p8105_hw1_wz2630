Problem 1
```{r}
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")

# the variables in this dataset, including names / values of important variables
str(early_january_weather)

# the size of the dataset
nrow(early_january_weather)

ncol(early_january_weather)

#the mean temperature
mean(early_january_weather$temp)

#scatterplot
library(ggplot2)
scatterplot <- ggplot(data = early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, col = humid)) + 
  geom_point(na.rm = T) + 
  labs(y = "Temperature", x = "Time of day", title = "Temperature at different hours of the day in early January")

```
In the early_january_weather, there are 358 observations and 15 variables. The mean of temp is 39.58.
